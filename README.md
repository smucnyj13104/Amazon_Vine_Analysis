###What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

- 51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 38.70% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

##Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

- There is a positivity bias for Vine reviews as a greater percentage of them were 5 stars vs. non-Vine reviews.

##Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
- I could compare the average star ratings (i.e., not just count the 5 star reviews, but average all the ratings) for Vine vs. non-Vine reviews. If the average star rating is higher for Vine reviewes that would further suggest there is a positivity bias for Vine reviews.
